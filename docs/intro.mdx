## About

**GregTech**, originally created by Gregorious Technecities, is a mod that overhauls 
[IndustrialCraft2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/industrial-craft), adding several new machines, 
fluids, tools, and adjusting recipes to make them fit with its system, and to make everything work well together.

**GregTech Experimental** is a fully-featured port of GregTech 3 for modern minecraft versions.
It offers all features of GT3, in their original form, unchanged. Machines, covers, upgrades, tools, as you know them.
